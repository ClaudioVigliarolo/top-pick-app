  <h3 align="center">Top Pick Mobile App</h3>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
<br />
<br />

## Overview

The Top Pick app is based on the React Native Framework, which supports both IOS and Android devices. The app can be downloaded at this <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=it&gl=US"><strong>link</strong></a> from Google Play or at this <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=it&gl=US"><strong>link</strong></a> in the App Store.

<br />

### Structure

The App offers a new and simple way to find interesting conversational topics. From the drawer menu, you have access to the main screens of the app:
-a screen for finding topics sorted by category
-a screen for viewing liked questions
-a screen for changing the app settings

Additional screens of the app can be accessed from the bottom tab bar, which gives access to the search screen, where topics can be searched by keyword.

Once the user chooses a topic, he can select the questions he likes.
Finally, he can reorder the questions by dragging each question in the list using the right icon.
Once the user is ready, he can either export the selected questions to pdf or start a presentation where each question will be shown on a single page.

The app interacts with a backend LINK, to get updates and send reports about poor app content.
